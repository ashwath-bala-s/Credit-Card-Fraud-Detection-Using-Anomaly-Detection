# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Anomaly Detection

**Introduction:**
The frauds in the credit cards industry are stealing or using stolen cards, or take more an aggressive form such as account takeover, counterfeiting and much more. The magnitude of credit card frauds is growing larger each day due to ever-increasing online transactions. Anomaly detection is an unsupervised data processing technique to detect anomalies from the dataset. Anomalies are data points that stand out amongst other data points in the dataset and do not fit the normal behavior in the data. These data points or observations deviate from the datasetâ€™s normal behavioral patterns. The anomaly detection is very useful to detect fraud transactions just like in our case.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to develop an anomaly detection model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model will analyze patterns in transaction behavior to distinguish between legitimate and suspicious activities
